## Developing

When using direnv with
[nix-direnv](https://github.com/nix-community/nix-direnv), a dev shell using
the flake will automatically be loaded. Otherwise, `nix develop` can be used to
start a shell with all required dependencies.

Run `make watch` to start the server and watch for changes on the backend and frontend.
